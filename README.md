# Etch-A-Sketch

Etch-A-Sketch is a web-based drawing application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can draw on the Etch-A-Sketch by moving their cursor over the canvas, creating a line with the color and thickness of their choice. The Etch-A-Sketch can be cleared at any time, allowing the user to start over with a fresh canvas. Users can also download their drawing as a PNG image file.
